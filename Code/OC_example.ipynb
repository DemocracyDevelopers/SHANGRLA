    "## Overview of the assertion audit tool\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool requires as input:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ audit-specific and contest-specific parameters, such as\n",
    "    - whether to sample with or without replacement\n",
    "    - the name of the risk function to use, and any parameters it requires\n",
    "    - a risk limit for each contest to be audited\n",
    "    - the social choice function for each contest, including the number of winners\n",
    "    - candidate identifiers for each contest\n",
    "    - reported winner(s) for each contest\n",
    "    - an upper bound on the number of ballot cards that contain each contest\n",
    "    - an upper bound on the total number of cards across all contests\n",
    "    - whether to use card style information to target sampling\n",
    "+ a ballot manifest (see below)\n",
    "+ a random seed\n",
    "+ a file of cast vote records (for ballot-comparison audits)\n",
    "+ reported vote tallies for for each contest (for ballot-polling audits of plurality, supermajority, and approval social choice functions)\n",
    "+ json files of assertions for IRV contests (one file per IRV contest)\n",
    "+ human reading of voter intent from the paper cards selected for audit\n",
    "\n",
    "`use_style` controls whether the sample is drawn from all cards (`use_style == False`) or card style information is used\n",
    "to target the cards that purport to contain each contest (`use_style == True`).\n",
    "In the current implementation, card style information is inferred from cast-vote records, with additional 'phantom' CVRs if there could be more cards that contain a contest than is accounted for in the CVRs.\n",
    "Errors in the card style information are treated conservatively using the  \"phantoms-to-evil-zombies\" (~2EZ) approach ([Banuelos & Stark, 2012](https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.3413)) so that the risk limit remains valid, even if the CVRs misrepresent\n",
    "which cards contain which contests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two ways of sampling are treated differently. \n",
    "If the sample is to be drawn only from cards that--according to the CVR--contain a particular contest, and a sampled card turns out not to\n",
    "contain that contest, that is considered a discrepancy, dealt with using the ~2EZ approach.\n",
    "It is assumed that every CVR corresponds to a card in the manifest, but there might\n",
    "be cards cast in the contest for which there is no corresponding CVR. In that case,\n",
    "phantom CVRs are created to ensure that the audit is still truly risk-limiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an independent (i.e., not relying on the voting system) upper bound on the number of cards that contain the contest, if the number of CVRs that contain the contest does not exceed that bound, we can sample from paper purported to contain the contest and use the ~2EZ approach to deal with missing CVRs. This can greatly increase the efficiency of the audit if \n",
    "some contests appear on only a small percentage of the cast cards ([Glazer, Spertus, and Stark, 2021](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3457907)).\n",
    "If there are more CVRs than the upper bound on the number of cards, extra CVRs can be deleted provided\n",
    "that deletion does not change any contest outcome. See [Stark, 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.01362).\n",
    "(However, if there more CVRs than cards, that is evidence of a process failure.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Any sampled phantom card (i.e., a card for which there is no CVR) is treated as if its CVR is a non-vote (which it is), and as if its MVR was least favorable (an \"evil zombie\" producing the greatest doubt in every assertion, separately). Any sampled card for which there is a CVR is compared to its corresponding CVR. \n",
    "If the card turns out not to contain the contest (despite the fact that the CVR says it does), the MVR is treated in the least favorable way for each assertion (i.e., as a zombie rather than as a non-vote).\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool helps select cards for audit, and reports when the audit has found sufficiently strong evidence to stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool exports a log of all the audit inputs except the CVR file, but including the auditors' manually determined voter intent from the audited cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pre-10/2021 version used a single sample to audit all contests. "
